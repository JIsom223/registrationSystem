# registrationSystem
This is a simple registration system that will allow you to create a username and password as well as sign in with those same credentials. It will save the username and password to a file
When running the code, it will ask you to create an account, login, or exit the program.

Create:
When creating an account, the username is case sensitive, so you can have different variations of a username as long as it doesn't match exactly. If you enter a duplicated username, you will get an error and get another chance to enter a new one that doesn't exist.
You can create as many usernames and passwords as you want in ONE session. 

Login:
It will check to make sure the login exists in the registration text file. If it doesn't, you will receive an error and have another attempt at logging into your account. Since there is no login feautre, I simulated an automaitc log out so you can go back to the menu.

Exit:
After you exit the session, a message will let you know that all data in the text file will be deleted
